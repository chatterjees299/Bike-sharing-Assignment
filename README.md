### Bike_Sharing_README.md
=============================


Need to build a  model for the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the organization to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. Then based on the model they can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
